## Hi there 👋


I'm Karlo, and I'm on an exciting journey to become a developer! 🚀  
Currently, I'm diving into the fundamentals of web development, and here's what I've learned so far:  

- 🌟 **HTML**: Structuring the web like a pro!  
- 🎨 **CSS**: Styling and bringing life to my web pages.  

But the journey doesn't stop here! I'll be mastering **JavaScript** to add interactivity and logic to my creations. ⚡

🌱 **Next Steps**:  
- Sharpen my skills in JavaScript.  
- Build awesome web projects to put my knowledge into practice.  
- Explore more programming languages and tools as I grow.
