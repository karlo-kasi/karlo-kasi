## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Karlo, and I'm on an exciting journey to become a developer! ðŸš€  
Currently, I'm diving into the fundamentals of web development, and here's what I've learned so far:  

- <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-E34F26?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white" />: Structuring the web like a pro!  
- <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-1572B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white" />: Styling and bringing life to my web pages.  

But the journey doesn't stop here! I'll be mastering **JavaScript** to add interactivity and logic to my creations. âš¡

ðŸŒ± **Next Steps**:  
- Sharpen my skills in JavaScript.  
- Build awesome web projects to put my knowledge into practice.  
- Explore more programming languages and tools as I grow.
